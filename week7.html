            Why is the JavaScript textContent property safer than innerHTML?

        <p>
           textContent is safer becaus it only messes with the displayed writable text of the html in quesion. Where the innerHTML
           can mess with all of the parts of the HTML. This makes textContent a little safer to play with because it can only change the text
           where the innerHTML can chage both the text and how it is displayed.

            Explain the relationship between an HTML attribute and a corresponding DOM property 
            (explain the connection to JavaScript).  Use a specific example in your answer

                Answer
        </p>
        <p>
            An HTML attribute is a thing that describes what is going on in the HTML and how to display something on the screan. The DOM 
            is a packaged portion of code that is made from the attributes with all of the other programming things attached to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So an attribute is for the programmer to look at and fiddle with, that then gets packaged up to make a DOM that has
            all of the other nitt-gritty things that the web page needs for the webpage to happen. But, the programmer can still fiddle 
            with the guts of the DOM by calling certain functions inside of it. 
        </p>
        <P>
            an example is in this very webpage. The button below is described in the HTML using attributes like button, or id, or the
            text inside the button. The DOM then pagages that up for the programes that make web pages happen, and then the button gets 
            fiddeled with later with the getElementById function that is apart of the DOM process. 
        </P>
